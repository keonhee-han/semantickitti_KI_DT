    configs/: This directory stores configuration files for different training components.
        data_loader.py: This file defines the SemanticKittiDataLoader class for loading and processing SemanticKitti data.
        data_loader_backup.py: blue print script
        loss.py: This file defines the CrossEntropyLoss class for calculating the cross-entropy loss for semantic segmentation.
        optimizer.py: This file defines the AdamOptimizer class for using the Adam optimizer during training.
    data/: This directory stores the actual semantic segmentation data (assuming SemanticKitti format here).
    eval.py: This file defines logic for evaluating the trained model on a validation set.
    main.py: This file serves as the entry point for your training script. It loads configurations, prepares data loaders, defines the model and optimizer, and then calls the training function.
    models/: This directory contains the model definition.
        semantic_segmentation_mlp.py: This file defines the SemanticSegmentationMLP class for the semantic segmentation model using an MLP architecture.
    train.py: This file defines the train function that performs the actual training loop, handling data loading, forward pass, backpropagation, and optimization steps.

Running the Project

    Install dependencies: Make sure you have PyTorch and other required libraries installed. You can use a package manager like pip to install them.
    Prepare data: Download the SemanticKitti dataset and place it in the data directory.
    Configure training: Edit the configuration files in the configs directory to adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, etc.
    Train the model: Run the main.py script. This will train the model on the provided data.
    Evaluate the model: Use the eval.py script to evaluate the trained model on a validation set (if available).
